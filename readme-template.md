## Reflection
 

This was a 1 week long coding project which I worked on along with my office work load. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and. Originally the requirement was to build an application that allowed users to pull data from the BandsinTown API based on what they were interested in, such as Artist's details. I started this process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate. At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are Reactjs, Material/UI, Enzymes & Jest for unit testing, GitHub for version controlling, and a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX, and CSS. I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes.
